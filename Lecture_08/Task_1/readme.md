Create a new version of our homework with the deck of cards.
Move Deck and Card to a different package. Call it cardgame. (you may use a single file in
it called cardgame.go)
Create a second package called carddraw (you may use a single file in it called
carddraw.go)
In the carddraw package, create an unexported interface called dealer. It will specify
the Decksâ€™s Deal method, without being in the same package as Deck. Create a function
called DrawAllCards with the following specification ->

package carddraw

type dealer interface {
    Deal() *cardgame.Card
}

func DrawAllCards(dealer dealer) []cardgame.Card {
    // call the dealer's Draw() method, until you reach a nil Card
}


Use the main function in the main package as the gluing layer between the two
other packages. It will create a concrete implementation of cardgame.Deck
and pass it to carddraw's ' DrawAllCards function. It will then assign the
resulting slice and print it on the screen using fmt.Println()
